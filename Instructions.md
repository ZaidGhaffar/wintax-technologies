Create a responsive image carousel (slider) component using Next.js (with TailwindCSS styling). Requirements:

The carousel should automatically transition between 3 different images every 1 second.

There should be no navigation buttons, arrows, or manual controls â€” it should slide automatically.

The transition should be smooth and either a fade or swipe effect (depending on what's simpler).

Images must be optimized using Next.js Image component with fill and object-cover.

The carousel should be wrapped in a rounded border container (rounded-xl, border, etc.).

Use minimal, clean Tailwind classes.

The component must be functional and reusable.
